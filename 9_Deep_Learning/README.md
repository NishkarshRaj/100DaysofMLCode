## Deep Learning
<br>
Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans.It's a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. 
<br> 
1. Deep learning requires large amounts of labeled data.
<br>
2.Deep learning requires substantial computing power.

### What's the difference between deep learning and Machine Learning?
<br> 
Machine learning and deep learning are both types of AI. In short, machine learning is AI that can automatically adapt with minimal human interference. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to mimic the learning process of the human brain.

### Here we have two types  of neural network:

[1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)](Artificial_Neural_Networks)

[2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)](Convolutional_Neural_Networks)
