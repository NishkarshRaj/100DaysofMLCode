## Applications of Machine Learning

1. Facial Recognition <br>
&ensp; i. Example: Facebook automatically tags the people in our group photo

2. Virtual Reality Headsets

3. Speech to text using NLP (Natural Language Processing) <br>
&ensp; i. Google Assistant<br> &ensp;ii. Alexa<br> &ensp;iii. Siri<br> &ensp;iv. Cortana, etc.

4. Online advertisements based on User interests

5. Netflix Shows based on popular themes of shows.

**Note: Netflix first show aired 'House of Cards' aired more than 5 years after Netflix came into existence and it was a massive hit because netflix had keenly observed user interest.**

## Machine Learning is the future - Data Explosion

Data is invaluable. Analyzing patterns in data and maximizing value using Big Data tools is the need of the future.
Every day, every human generates 1.7 MB of data on average every second. This amount of data can only be managed by machines but the patterns to analyze them come from human empiricism. Enter: Machine Learning.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 

The idea came from work in artificial intelligence. Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms which can learn and make predictions on data. Such algorithms follow programmed instructions, but can also make predictions or decisions based on data. They build a model from sample inputs.

Machine learning is done where designing and programming explicit algorithms cannot be done.

## Installation of Anaconda Python

1. Download Anaconda Python for Python 3.7 from this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. Install Anaconda by executing the downloaded file.
3. Open Anaconda Prompt and type in <code>conda</code>. If you get an error, Anaconda was not installed properly. Otherwise, proceed to step 4.
4. Open **Anaconda Navigator** on your system.
5. Open Spyder IDE for Python.
6. Create HelloWorld code and execute it to check successful installation.

## Installation of R Studio and R programming Language

1. Go to this [link](https://cran.r-project.org/) to download and install R Programming language. 
2. Download R Studio IDE from this [link](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
* RStudio automatically configures R programming language already installed on the machine.
3. Open RStudio and enter Hello World code to check successful installation.

## Opening a Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda Prompt
1. Open *Anaconda Prompt* on your system.
2. The current directory in which your project will move will be 'C:\Users\username'. To change the directory or working folder, ender the      command: cd Folder_Location. Say E:\Machine Learning\100DaysofMLCode is the folder, You want to work on. The command for the same will be 
   cd E:\Machine Learning\100DaysofMLCode. (cd means change directory)
3. When you'll execute the command, the directory will be changed. If not, enter the command: Local_Disk: (it will be E: in the example          case).
4. Your working directory will be changed by now, enter the command 'Jupyter Notebook'. You will now be directed to your Web Browser with      your Jupyter Notebook opened.
5. Click on the New option in the Upper Right Corner and you can write your code. Begin with print('Hello! This is my First Jupyter            Notebook. Thanks to 100DaysofMLCode.')
