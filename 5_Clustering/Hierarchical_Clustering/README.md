# HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING
There are two types of hierarchical clustering:
- Agglomerative
- Divisive

Here, we look at **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**

It includes the following algorithm:
- Step 1: Make each data point a single point cluster. This forms N clusters where N is the total number of points.
- Step 2: Take the two closest data points and make them one cluster. This forms N-1 clusters.
- Step 3: Take the two closesr clusters and make them one cluster. This forms N-2 clusters.
- Step 4: Repeat step 3 until there is only one cluster.
- FINISH
